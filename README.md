# convert_bufer_to_html
I made this python file for our analyst, who was struggling with converting xml response to html format.❤❤❤

To use it, all you need is to copy your data to the clipboard and run this file.
It will automatically convert the data to html, open your default browser, and save a copy to your desktop.
